# Phase Portrait Diagram Generation

phase_plane.py is the main code for this repo. It generates a phase portrait with x-axis $\beta$ (side-slip angle) and y-axis $r$ (yaw velocity). Each diagram holds $\delta$ (steering angle) and $v_{x}$ (longitudinal velocity) constant while plotting the derivatives $\dot{\beta}$ and $\dot{r}$ as a quiver plot.
